<b>PROLOGUE:</b>
<BR><BR>
A woman sits in an airplane waiting for it to take off, her minde racing. She thinks to herself. “Three years ago I never would have thought I'd be doing this. Flying across the country to see the man I'm going to marry. Someone I've never met. Maybe we won't get married. Maybe he won't like me. I know I'll like him. I just know... but he might not like me. I feel like Cinderella, about to meet her Prince Charming.” She smiles. 
<BR><BR>
The plane starts to get in position to take off. She looks around. Starting to get butterflies. There's a lay over in some town in Texas, then a flight to California where her man will be waiting for her. 
<BR><BR>
On the other end of the flight, Steven Waits. Wondering if she'll like what she sees. They both lack self confidence. Both feel like they love each other, but they haven't met. They both find themselves unattractive, they always tell each other that it's not about looks, but neither seems to believe the other. 
<BR><BR>
Steven gets their early. Hoping it'll help calm his nerves. He's sits in a seat near the entrance. He's checking his cell phone every 5 minutes. When he noticed the plane should arrive in 30 minutes, he starts to stand. Pacing back and forth. 
<BR><BR>
Em on the plane, nervously shakes a little bit. Taping the arm rests with her nails. Suddenly the plane lands. It's time to get out. Fresno is not a huge air port. It won't take much time for them to finally meet. 
<BR><BR>
Steven's cell phone goes off. It's Em. “I've landed.” It said.
<BR><BR>
Steven responded with a smiley face emoji and a “Hurry up, beautiful.” 
<BR><BR>
Em sent a smiley face emoji as well with “On my way, handsome.” after it. 
<BR><BR>
Passengers started coming out past the TSA area, towards baggage claim. He saw his beauty. She walked straight up to him. They looked at each other , then he opened up his arms and she walked right into them and they hugged. 
<BR><BR>
<b>CHAPTER 1:</b>
<BR><BR>
They met a couple years ago, online. They used an online chat device that used 3D avatars to hang out. She knew it was love immediately. Him, not so much. He was clearly a fool. Their avatars ended up sitting together, and they became friends. Then they became best friends. There was a time where they almost became more than friends. But things happen... then Steven went through girlfriend and after girlfriend while Em became his best friend and waited. 
<BR><BR>
Em was hanging out with her best friend, sitting on her bed. 
<BR><BR>
“How long you going to wait for this guy?” Her best friend asked her.
<BR><BR>
“Forever.” She laid back on the bed.
<BR><BR>
She shooker her head at Em. “You need to find another guy. He doesn't realize how great you are. He's just some online guy anyways. Not even real.” 
<BR><BR>
“I don't care.”
<BR><BR>
“Fine.” Her best friend looked at her then grabbed her phone.
<BR><BR>
“Hey! Give that back.”
<BR><BR>
“I'm going to tell him to stop being dumb.” 
<BR><BR>
Em started fighting for the phone. “Give it back.”
<BR><BR>
“Nope.”
<BR><BR>
Em started tickling her.
<BR><BR>
“Hey. Stop! I'm helping you here!“ She wiggled around a little.
<BR><BR>
“No. Phone!”
<BR><BR>
“Fine!” She hands Em the phone back. “But you know what?”
<BR><BR>
“What?”
<BR><BR>
She wiggled her fingers at Em.
<BR><BR>
“Hey I barely tickled you!”
<BR><BR>
“Okay fine.” She layed on the bed.
<BR><BR>
Em laid next to her, her friend smiled and rolled over on top of her and started tickling Em.”
<BR><BR>
“Hey! No! Hahahaha!” Em started laughing and wiggling around.
<BR><BR>
Her friend just keeps tickling. 
<BR><BR>
“Okay! I give! Hahahahahahaha! Pleaseeee.” 
<BR><BR>
She stops, but slaps her butt real quick. 
<BR><BR>
“Hey there!” 
<BR><BR>
“Sorry, it's a nice butt. Now, back to your love life.”
<BR><BR>
“I thought we were moving on.”
<BR><BR>
“Come on Em. Some day you're going to have to meet him, or move on. “
<BR><BR>
“I know.” She lays back and thanks about it... 
<BR><BR>
<b>CHAPTER 2:</b>
<BR><BR>
Back at the Fresno airport, Steven and Em walk out the door. Steven helped her with her luggage and lead her out to his vehicle. And they drove off. 
<BR><BR>
“Where we headed?”
<BR><BR>
“A hotel near by, hope you don't mind. Let's get you settled in before we decide we want to do something else. You look amazing by the way.”
<BR><BR>
She blushed and smiled, putting her hands on her face. “Sure.” She said, hesitantly. 
<BR><BR>
“Are you okay?”
<BR><BR>
“Yeah, just a little nervous.” 
<BR><BR>
“Me too.”
<BR><BR>
They pulled into a nice hotel, and got all checked in. Steven carried her bags to her room. She opened and they went in. Steven put down her luggage. Em sat on the bed, and he looked towards. This is his first time really getting a good look at her, so he looked her up and down. She was just a little over 5 feet, in a short jean skirt that went just past the thighs, white tube top, blonde hair, with brown eyes. Beautiful. He then walked towards you and looked down at her, standing right in front of her. 
<BR><BR>
“Hi.” He said with a smile.
<BR><BR>
“Hi” she responded back, wrapping her arms around him, he did the same. 
<BR><BR>
“You are so beautiful.” 
<BR><BR>
“I'm glad you think so. So what are we going to do?”
<BR><BR>
“I don't know. I figured you needed a rest after your flight.”
<BR><BR>
“Rest does sound good. Shower first. “ She jumps out of bed, and looks at him. “You staying?” 
<BR><BR>
“I'm not going anywhere.” He smiled at her.
<BR><BR>
“Good.” She grabbed some clothes and looked back at him. “No peaking!” 
<BR><BR>
“Wouldn't dream of it.”
<BR><BR>
She went into the bathroom, closed the door partially then smiled back at him, shutting it the rest of the way. He heard the shower turn on and then laid on the bed. A little while later the shower turned off, a few moments after that she came back out, wearing comfortable shorts and a t shirt and jumped on the bed. 
<BR><BR>
“Hi baby.” She told him, climbing on top of him.
<BR><BR>
“Well someone isn't nervous anymore.”
<BR><BR>
“Well, I get a feeling you're as awesome as you seem. So what do you want to do? You finally got me here.” She lays her head on Steven's chest.
<BR><BR>
Steven smiles and carefully rolls over so he's on top and smiles down at you.
<BR><BR>
“Well there is something I've been wanting to do for a long time.” He told her. 
<BR><BR>
“What's that?”
<BR><BR>
“See if you're just as ticklish as you said.”
<BR><BR>
Her eyes went big. “You wouldn't dare!”
<BR><BR>
“Oh, I so would.” 
<BR><BR>
“Don't... don't... don't...”
<BR><BR>
Her pleas fell on deaf ears. He immediately started tickling her sides.
<BR><BR>
“If I hit you.... hahah hahahah ahahaha!” She started laughing before she could finish talking. Squirming around 
<BR><BR>
The tickling got quicker, and her squirming got quicker. “Hahahahhaha! Please! Hahahahahhehaha!”
<BR><BR>
Steven didn't stop. And he didn't say anything either. He just kept up the tickling. 
<BR><BR>
“Ok! Ok! Hahahahahehhehahah! Hahaha!” She started banging her hands on the bed. She tried very hard to resist hitting him, taking it out on the bed instead. But after a couple minutes of him tickling her sides, she tried her best to push him off. 
<BR><BR>
He stopped and looks down at her. She started breathing heavily. He just laid there, smiling down at her. When she caught her breath, she glared at him. He leaned in and kisses her cheek.
<BR><BR>
“Don't be mad. “ He laid down next to her.
<BR><BR>
“I'm not mad.” She rolled back on top of him and give him a kiss on his lips.
<BR><BR>
He kissed back. Then he looked up at her. I can't believe you're actually here. 
<BR><BR>
“Well I am here. So kiss me and tickle you while you can.” She smiled down at him.
<BR><BR>
“Okay.” He pulled her back down for another kiss. 
<BR><BR>
He then rolled back over so he was on top again and they started kissing passionately. Steven slid his tongue in her mouse, and their tongues touched. Steven's hands slid down and lightly grabbed her butt. Em smiled against his lips. He kept kissing her passionately, as he rubbed her butt, their tongues still touching. Em kissed him back just as passionately. 
<BR><BR>
Steven pulled his head back a little. “We're not rushing this are we?” 
<BR><BR>
“We've known each other for a long time. Been waiting for this. Kiss me baby.” 
<BR><BR>
He smiles down, and then goes for her neck, starts nibbling up and down it. She giggles a bit, then he blows a raspberry on her neck. She giggles more and tries to scrunch her neck.
<BR><BR>
“Sorry, couldn't resist.”
<BR><BR>
“Uhhuh.” 
<BR><BR>
He starts sucking on her neck. She moaned, he smiled and continues sucking, his hands were back on her butt. This went on for a while, somewhere along the make out session, her shirt came off. He was kissing all over her belly, up her ribs, and suddenly stopped at her breasts.
<BR><BR>
She looked down at him. “ I'm not sure we should do that yet.”
<BR><BR>
“Okay baby, whatever your comfortable with. How about this...” He blow a raspberry right under her belly button.
<BR><BR>
She laughed. “Baby!”
<BR><BR>
“What?” He blew another.
<BR><BR>
She wiggled around laughing. “Baby!” 
<BR><BR>
He started an all out tickle assault on her bare belly. 
<BR><BR>
“Yes, baby! I'm ticklish! Hahahahah! Hahahahahaahah!” 
<BR><BR>
“I love how ticklish you are.” He said, continuing his tickle assault.
<BR><BR>
“Yes! Yes! Now stop! Hahahahaha hehhehehehehe!”
<BR><BR>
He stopped and smiles at her. “Would you ever consider letting me tie you up.”
<BR><BR>
She closed her eyes, taking in some breaths before answers, “That is something I'd have to think about.” 
<BR><BR>
 He smiled, leaned in. She tensed up a bit, getting ready for another tickle assault. He just started kissing all around her stomach.
 <BR><BR>
<b>CHAPTER 3:</b>
<BR><BR>
Steven was at his home, pacing back and forth. He was dressed nice. 
<BR><BR>
“Would you calm down.” Lance said. 
<BR><BR>
“Sorry.”
<BR><BR>
“And why didn't you tell me about this girl?”
<BR><BR>
“I don't know. Feelings, you know... I didn't tell anyone.”
<BR><BR>
“I'm supposed to be your best friend.”
<BR><BR>
“I'm sorry, it's just weird. I gotta go.” Steven headed towards the door.
<BR><BR>
He opened it.
<BR><BR>
“Do I get to meet her?”
<BR><BR>
“Sure. But not now.” Steven said, then exited, shutting the door. 
<BR><BR>
He drove over to her hotel room and knocked. She opened the door and his jaw dropped. “Wow.” He said.
<BR><BR>
She was wearing a silk red dress that went down just a little past her thighs, spaghetti straps, and shows off her assests quite nicely.
<BR><BR>
“I take it you like it.” 
<BR><BR>
“Yes ma'am.”
<BR><BR>
“Ooh, ma'am, I like the sound of that.” She smiled at him.
<BR><BR>
He held out his hand, she took it and they walked off. They headed to the vehicle and headed out to a nice Italian restaurant in central Fresno. They went inside to a dimly lit restaurant and we're seated almost immediately. 
<BR><BR>
“This place looks nice.” 
<BR><BR>
“It is. Food's pretty good.”
<BR><BR>
“Come here often?”
<BR><BR>
“Second time.”
<BR><BR>
“Oh, so that food being good, could have only been luck?”
<BR><BR>
“I suppose.”
<BR><BR>
They ordered. She seemed to enjoy it. Three course meal. 
<BR><BR>
He smiled at her, watching her finish her food. “You seemed to enjoy it. You ready for me to go and get tied up?”
<BR><BR>
“What?” She said, surprised he suggested that.
<BR><BR>
“I was just kidding.”
<BR><BR>
“Good.” 
<BR><BR>
“That is how our first online date ended that.”
<BR><BR>
“Yeah, but that was fake though. It'll take a couple more dates before we're there. “
<BR><BR>
“So, third date?”
<BR><BR>
“I don't know.”
<BR><BR>
“Fifth?”
<BR><BR>
“Lets just go.” 
<BR><BR>
Steven paid the waiter and they stood up, she started walking towards the exit. 
<BR><BR>
“Okay, but you are going to get tickled when we get back to your hotel.”
<BR><BR>
“Thats fine.” She smiles back at him. “You better throw in some kisses too.”
<BR><BR>
“Of course.”
<BR><BR>
They arrived back at the hotel. Em walked in front, and ran onto the bed as soon as she entered the bed. Laid down, her hands were up and and she put them under her head, then looked at him. 
<BR><BR>
“Okay, what are you going to do.” She smiled at him. 
<BR><BR>
He jumped on the bed, put her little feet on his lap. “I think I'm going to start here.”
<BR><BR>
Her eyes got big. “No baby, not my feet.”
<BR><BR>
“Why not?” He asked then scratched her feet slightly.
<BR><BR>
Her leg kicked a little bit. “If I kick you, that's your fault.”
<BR><BR>
“I think it'll be worth it. Lets see how much you can control yourself.”
<BR><BR>
“I'll try. Just go easy.”
<BR><BR>
“I'll start easy.”
<BR><BR>
He slightly scratched her feet, and kept scratching them. She started giggling, her feet wiggled a little bit.
<BR><BR>
“Good girl.” 
<BR><BR>
She smiled at him. 
<BR><BR>
“I'm going to go a little bit quicker.”
<BR><BR>
He did, and her feet wiggled quicker, ocassionally kicked a little bit. And gigles got louded. 
<BR><BR>
“Hahahahahehaha!You're going to get kicked! Hahahahahahah!!”
<BR><BR>
He put one of his arms over her legs, trying to hold them onto his lap; and started tickling quicker. 
<BR><BR>
“Hahahahahaahah! Hehahahaha! Okay! Move on!”
<BR><BR>
He ignored her, just kept tickling her little feet. 
<BR><BR>
“Hahahahahahaha! Pleaseeeee baby! Hahahahahhehahah!”
<BR><BR>
He brought one of her feet up to his mouth. Her eyes got even bigger. 
<BR><BR>
“What are you going to do?” 
<BR><BR>
He put her foot in his mouth and started sucking on her toes.
<BR><BR>
“Wow.”
<BR><BR>
He continued sucking on her toes. She moaned a little. 
<BR><BR>
“I can't believe this feels so good.”  She laid back smiling. 
<BR><BR>
He then started nibbling on her feet. 
<BR><BR>
She started laughing again. “Babbbbyyy! Suck please!! Hahahahahahehehaha! Hahahahah!”
<BR><BR>
He started nibbling up and down her foott.
<BR><BR>
“Hahahahahha.” She tied to kick her foot
<BR><BR>
He put her foot down then smiled up at her. 
<BR><BR>
She took some deep breaths. “That was unexpected.”
<BR><BR>
He just looked at her and sat on her legs, right by her knees, slid his hands between her legs, started tickling her inner thighs. She immediately closed them but that just trapped his fingers on her inner thighs and he was able to continue wiggling his fingers. 
<BR><BR>
“Hahahahahahehaha! Hehahahahah! You're making me so hot!”
<BR><BR>
“Why because I'm playing with your thighs?” He stopped tickling for a minute.
<BR><BR>
She just shook her head. He went back to tickling her thighs. 
<BR><BR>
“Well you trapped them down there. Just gonna wiggle in one place.”
<BR><BR>
“I don't care! I love thissss. Hahahahahehahaha! Kiss me!” 
<BR><BR>
He leans down and kisses  around the top of her thighs, pushing the dress up a little bit to reveal more sexy thigh. He then carefully forced her thighs open so he could untrap his hands and kept kissing around her  thighs, as his hands moved up and started tickling around her belly. She didn't know whether to moan or laugh. What came out was a mixture of both. 
<BR><BR>
“Hahahahah! Hahahehehahahah! 
<BR><BR>
He sould stop tickling her ocassionally to let her enjoy his lips on her bare thighs, he slid it between her thighs and started kissing her. 
<BR><BR>
“Okay baby. Not yet..”
<BR><BR>
He brought his head back up “Okay, but you know what that means right?” He smiles at her and went back to tickle attacking her belly.
<BR><BR>
“Hahahahaha! Hahahahahehhahaha! I knooooo hahahahaahahaah!” She laughed between words, and in the middle of words. 
<BR><BR>
After a few days of knowing each other, she was definitely singing a different tone. Letting him kiss wherever he wanted. They both laid in bed, topless. 
<BR><BR>
“Tomorrow huh?” He said, a little sad.
<BR><BR>
“Yeah, tomorrow.” She replied. 
<BR><BR>
“I want more of you then.” He quickly rolled over on top of her, dug his face into her neck and started kissing it.
<BR><BR>
“Ok baby. You can have me.” 
<BR><BR>
“I'm a little hungry.” 
<BR><BR>
“Okay want to order...”
<BR><BR>
In the middle of speaking he started nibbling on her neck. 
<BR><BR>
“Hahaha! Okay, hungry for me. Got it.” She tilted her head a little to give him more room.
<BR><BR>
He stopped for a second. “Yeah.” And went back to nibbling on her neck. 
<BR><BR>
She smiled and ran her fingers through his hair. He started moving down, kissing her shoulders, then her arms, then all around her belly. 
<BR><BR>
“I love this belly.”
<BR><BR>
“I'm glad you do.” 
<BR><BR>
He licked around her belly button. 
<BR><BR>
“I'm wet.”
<BR><BR>
“I like getting you wet.” 
<BR><BR>
“I know you do.”
<BR><BR>
He licked up her ribs, she giggled. He blew on her nipples.
<BR><BR>
“Haha! Baby!”
<BR><BR>
He smiled,  lowered his head and started sucking on her breasts. She moaned almost immediately. He started sucking quicker, she kept moaning. He took one of his hands and moved it around and moved it around the nipple of the breast he's not sucking. 
<BR><BR>
“Baby!” She moaned. 
<BR><BR>
He smiled with his lips pressed against her boob, and continued sucking. 
<BR><BR>
“I so want you inside me.” 
<BR><BR>
She didn't have to tell him twice. He got undressed the rest of the way then helped her.”
<BR><BR>
She smiled up at him. “Well, you were quick.”
<BR><BR>
“I know. “ He looked at her and then climbs on top of her.
<BR><BR>
He thrust inside her, as his lips started kissing her lips passionately. He started wiggling deeper inside her as they kissed. Her tongue went inside his mouth, and stated to tongue wrestle  with him, eventually calming the tongue down and just touched inside the mouth and they continued to kiss passionately. Her hands up on his head, almost pulling his hair out as he moved around inside her. His hands also on her beautiful hair, but gently running through it. He pulled his mouth away from hers, and then once again buried his head, once again, in her neck, sucking on it slowly. Gradually he started sucking on her neck quicker. She moaned. She wiggled a little under him, and he went a little bit deeper inside her while sucking on her neck.
<BR><BR>
“Ooh baby, don't stop.” 
<BR><BR>
He stopped and looked up at her. “I wasn't planning on it.”
<BR><BR>
She laughed. “Ok baby.”
<BR><BR>
He moved back down to her neck and started sucking again. 
<BR><BR>
“How about lower?” Em said.
<BR><BR>
He smiles and kissed her shoulders, then down to her boobs and starts sucking on them.
<BR><BR>
“There you go.” She moaned. 
<BR><BR>
He sucked on them quicker, then moved his tongue around the nipples while his mouth was still on them and started sucking on them more. She moaned again. He started sucking slower on them, still inside her, wiggled around on top of her. 
<BR><BR>
“Baby..” 
<BR><BR>
He started sucking on her quicker, wiggling more, playing with the other breast with my finger, moving my index finger around the nipples. She moaned again. 
<BR><BR>
“Oh baby. Keep doing that to my nipple. “
<BR><BR>
He moved his finger quicker around her nipple, still sucking on her other breast, then brought his mouth up and started nibbling around her nipple. She moaned once again. He suddenly felt something on him, coming out of her. He started licking around her nipples, more came out. He started to release as well. She could feel it in her, and she moaned again. 
<BR><BR>
“Baby! I love you so much.”  Her head laid back with a big smile on her face. 
<BR><BR>
“I love you so much too my love.” He said, lifting his head up away from her breast, them just laid it right in the middle of her breasts, looking at her.
<BR><BR>
<b>CHAPTER 4:</b>
<BR><BR>
Next day. The day neither one of them wanted to come. Steven's house. He walks up to Lance and opens up a ring case.
<BR><BR>
“Wow dude. That looks nice.”
<BR><BR>
“Thanks. I'm going to ask Em to marry me.”
<BR><BR>
“Isn't it a little soon?”
<BR><BR>
“I've known her for a couple years. How is it soon?”
<BR><BR>
“Not in real life.”
<BR><BR>
“Oh well. I'm going to do it anyways.”
<BR><BR>
“All right, well good luck.”
<BR><BR>
“I don't need luck.” He opened and walked out the door, shutting it behind him.
<BR><BR>
He knocked on Em's hotel room, she opened it. His eyes nearly popped out of his eye sockets.
<BR><BR>
“Now's when you decide to wear leather. I'm about to take you to the airport and I just want to place with your sexy body.”
<BR><BR>
Leather skirt, barely passed her thighs, leather top that barely covered her breasts. 
<BR><BR>
“I wanted to give you something to remember me by.”
<BR><BR>
“How long do we have?”
<BR><BR>
“Baby, we gotta go.” She grabbed her luggage and walked out the door. 
<BR><BR>
“You're such a tease.” His eyes dropped to her ass as she walked out the door. “Mmm, mmm, mmm. You're so hot.” 
<BR><BR>
He walked up to her and gently rubbed her butt. 
<BR><BR>
“Baby!” She turned her head and looked at him. “You better not make me late for my plane.”
<BR><BR>
“Like you didn't know it would get a reaction out of me.”
<BR><BR>
She stopped walking. “I knew.” She smiled and started walking again.
<BR><BR>
The got to the air port a little early, sat down in the chairs outside the TSA area. Steven Smiled at her then gave her a kiss. 
<BR><BR>
“I should tickle you right in front of everyone for wearing this outfit.”
<BR><BR>
“You wouldn't dare.” 
<BR><BR>
“Yes I would.” He smiled.
<BR><BR>
His hand landed on her thigh, and he slipped it between her legs and lightly tickled her inner thighs. She giggled and pulled his hand away. 
<BR><BR>
“Baby, not in front of people.” 
<BR><BR>
“Fine, but you're mean. Wearing this outfit and no tickles.” 
<BR><BR>
“Kiss me.” He looked at her and kissed her. 
<BR><BR>
They kissed passionately, his hand slipped onto her skirt and he started rubbing it as they kissed. He then pulled away.
<BR><BR>
“So tickling is bad, but kissing isn't?”
<BR><BR>
“Tickling will make me laugh and roll around. Kissing is less noticable.
<BR><BR>
“I see.”
<BR><BR>
“I should probably go though.”
<BR><BR>
“Probably, but before you do, I have a question and something to give you.”
<BR><BR>
“Oh?” 
<BR><BR>
He took the ring out of his pocket and opened it.”I know technically we've only known each other in real life for a week, but I've known you for a couple years now and you seem just like I pictured so I'm thinking, why wait to ask?”
<BR><BR>
“Baby...”
<BR><BR>
“Will you marry me?”
<BR><BR>
“Yes! Yes!” She said then kissed him passionately.
<BR><BR>
When they stopped kissing, he put the ring on her finger.
<BR><BR>
“I've got to go. When I get back home, I'll call you. Work out the details.”
<BR><BR>
“It's not going to be easy.” 
<BR><BR>
“No, but it'll be worth it” She turned away to leave, he swatted her ass one time.
<BR><BR>
“Ooh!”
<BR><BR>
She walked off into the TSA line.
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
