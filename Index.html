Wrote my first story when I was 10. Sometimes I wish I still had that story. I've tried to recreate it,
I can't. I guess my imagination was better back then. I have three stories published on Amazon that aren't 
making me any money, so why bother? Here are some of my stories. I love to write, but hate to read. 
Sometimes my stories get a bit dialogue heavy. But the important parts have good descriptions. Take a look.
No, my stories aren't for young eyes.
